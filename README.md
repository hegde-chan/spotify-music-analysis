This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Getting started
You will need Spotify Premium and a developer account. Create an app in the [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and then create a `.env` file in the project root with the following contents:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = yourclientid
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = yourclientsecret
```
Then run `npm run dev` to start the application. Rember to run `npm install` if this is your first time starting the application.


### Using The Application
![App Screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true "App Screenshot")
First, log in using your Spotify account. Then, search for a track as you normally would on Spotify, and click one of the options to have an audio analysis pop up while the track plays so you can judge for yourself.
